# Python-Flask-Website-project3

This time, my python flask project is a simple website with mutltiple webpasges that are linked together. My theme this time is about STATES OF MATTER

## If you want my code, you can clone this repo or just download it directly







## SET UP
### To setup THE REQUIRED FRAME WORK:

1. go to your cmd and then enter this command : 'pip install flask' in your directory
   #### note: if you are using an IDE, just go the the terminal and enter the command

2. Make a python folder/directory and paste the content of my folder (You can use my folder directly ;), we are just trying to be more organized on our code.)
   #### note: You can notice that we have our separate folder for html file it is because that's how it should be. You need to separate each of your files into different folders based on its file extension it is for the flask read your files (ex : images folder for image, css for css files, and so on) you can also install virtual environment, it will provide a better file structures and directory. just type the command: pip install venv
